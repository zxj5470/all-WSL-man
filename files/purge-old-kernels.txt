NAME
       purge-old-kernels - remove old kernel and header packages from the system

SYNOPSIS
       purge-old-kernels [--keep N] [*]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  will  remove old kernel and header packages from the system, freeing disk space.  It will never
       remove the currently running kernel.  By default, it will keep at least the latest 2 kernels, but the user can
       override  that  value  using  the --keep parameter.  Any additional parameters will be passed directly to apt-
       get(8).

       This program requires administrative access.

EXAMPLE
       sudo purge-old-kernels --keep 3 -qy

SEE ALSO
       apt-get(8)
