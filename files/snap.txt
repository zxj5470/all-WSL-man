snap(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                        snap(1)

NAME
       snap - Tool to interact with snaps

SYNOPSIS
       snap [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Install,  configure,  refresh  and  remove snap packages. Snaps are enabling secure distribution of the latest
       apps and utilities for cloud, servers, desktops and the internet of things.

       This is the CLI for snapd, a background service that takes care of snaps on the system. Start with 'snap list'
       to see installed snaps.

OPTIONS
   Application Options
COMMANDS
   abort
       Abort a pending change

       The abort command attempts to abort a change that still has pending tasks.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] abort [abort-OPTIONS]

       --last Select last change of given type (install, refresh, remove, try, auto-refresh etc.)

   ack
       Add an assertion to the system

       The ack command tries to add an assertion to the system assertion database.

       The assertion may also be a newer revision of a pre-existing assertion that it will replace.

       To  succeed the assertion must be valid, its signature verified with a known public key and the assertion con‐
       sistent with and its prerequisite in the database.

   alias
       Set up a manual alias

       The alias command aliases the given snap application to the given alias.

       Once this manual alias is setup the respective application command can be invoked just using the alias.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] alias [alias-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   aliases
       List aliases in the system

       The aliases command lists all aliases available in the system and their status.

       $ snap aliases <snap>

       Lists only the aliases defined by the specified snap.

       An alias noted as undefined means it was explicitly enabled or disabled but is  not  defined  in  the  current
       revision  of  the  snap,  possibly  temporarily (e.g.  because of a revert). This can cleared with 'snap alias
       --reset'.

   buy
       Buy a snap

       The buy command buys a snap from the store.

   changes
       List system changes

       The changes command displays a summary of system changes performed recently.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] changes [changes-OPTIONS]

       --abs-time
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times  up  to  60  days,  then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

   connect
       Connect a plug to a slot

       The connect command connects a plug to a slot.  It may be called in the following ways:

       $ snap connect <snap>:<plug> <snap>:<slot>

       Connects the provided plug to the given slot.

       $ snap connect <snap>:<plug> <snap>

       Connects the specific plug to the only slot in the provided snap that matches the connected interface. If more
       than one potential slot exists, the command fails.

       $ snap connect <snap>:<plug>

       Connects the provided plug to the slot in the core snap with a name matching the plug name.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] connect [connect-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   disable
       Disable a snap in the system

       The disable command disables a snap. The binaries and services of the snap will no longer  be  available,  but
       all the data is still available and the snap can easily be enabled again.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] disable [disable-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   disconnect
       Disconnect a plug from a slot

       The disconnect command disconnects a plug from a slot.  It may be called in the following ways:

       $ snap disconnect <snap>:<plug> <snap>:<slot>

       Disconnects the specific plug from the specific slot.

       $ snap disconnect <snap>:<slot or plug>

       Disconnects everything from the provided plug or slot.  The snap name may be omitted for the core snap.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] disconnect [disconnect-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   download
       Download the given snap

       The  download  command  downloads  the  given snap and its supporting assertions to the current directory with
       .snap and .assert file extensions, respectively.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] download [download-OPTIONS]

       --channel
              Use this channel instead of stable

       --edge Install from the edge channel

       --beta Install from the beta channel

       --candidate

              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   find
       Find packages to install

       The find command queries the store for available packages in the stable channel.

       With the --private flag, which requires the user to be logged-in to the store  (see  'snap  help  login'),  it
       instead  searches  for  private  snaps  that  the user has developer access to, either directly or through the
       store's collaboration feature.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] find [find-OPTIONS]

       Aliases: search

       --private
              Search private snaps

       --narrow
              Only search for snaps in “stable”

       --section [="show-all-sections-please"] <default: "no-section-specified">
              Restrict the search to a given section

   get
       Print configuration options

       The get command prints configuration options for the provided snap.

           $ snap get snap-name username
           frank

       If multiple option names are provided, a document is returned:

           $ snap get snap-name username password
           {
               "username": "frank",
               "password": "..."
           }

       Nested values may be retrieved via a dotted path:

           $ snap get snap-name author.name
           frank

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] get [get-OPTIONS]

       -t     Strict typing with nulls and quoted strings

       -d     Always return document, even with single key

       -l     Always return list, even with single key

   help
       Show help about a command

       The help command displays information about snap commands.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] help [help-OPTIONS]

          info
              Show detailed information about snaps

              The info command shows detailed information about snaps.

              The snaps can be specified by name or by path; names are looked for  both  in  the  store  and  in  the
              installed  snaps;  paths  can  refer  to a .snap file, or to a directory that contains an unpacked snap
              suitable for 'snap try' (an example of this would be the 'prime' directory snapcraft produces).

              Usage: snap [OPTIONS] info [info-OPTIONS]

       --abs-time
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times  up  to  60  days,  then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

       --verbose
              Include more details on the snap (expanded notes, base, etc.)

   install
       Install a snap to the system

       The install command installs the named snaps in the system.

       With  no  further  options, the snaps are installed tracking the stable channel, with strict security confine‐
       ment.

       Revision choice via the --revision override requires the the user to have developer access to the snap, either
       directly or through the store's collaboration feature, and to be logged in (see 'snap help login').

       Note  a later refresh will typically undo a revision override, taking the snap back to the current revision of
       the channel it's tracking.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] install [install-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       --candidate
              Install from the candidate channel

       --stable
              Install from the stable channel

       --devmode
              Put snap in development mode and disable security confinement

       --jailmode
              Put snap in enforced confinement mode

       --classic
              Put snap in classic mode and disable security confinement

       --revision
              Install the given revision of a snap, to which you must have developer access

       --dangerous
              Install the given snap file even if there are no pre-acknowledged signatures for it, meaning it was not
              verified and could be dangerous (--devmode implies this)

       --unaliased
              Install the given snap without enabling its automatic aliases

   interface
       List snap interfaces

       The interface command shows details of snap interfaces.

       If  no  interface name is provided, a list of interface names with at least one connection is shown, or a list
       of all interfaces if --all is provided.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] interface [interface-OPTIONS]

       --attrs
              Show interface attributes

       --all  Include unused interfaces

   interfaces
       List interfaces in the system

       The interfaces command lists interfaces available in the system.

       By default all slots and plugs, used and offered by all snaps, are displayed.

       $ snap interfaces <snap>:<slot or plug>

       Lists only the specified slot or plug.

       $ snap interfaces <snap>

       Lists the slots offered and plugs used by the specified snap.

       $ snap interfaces -i=<interface> [<snap>]

       Filters the complete output so only plugs and/or slots matching the provided details are listed.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] interfaces [interfaces-OPTIONS]

       -i     Constrain listing to specific interfaces

   known
       Show known assertions of the provided type

       The known command shows known assertions of the provided type.  If header=value pairs are provided  after  the
       assertion type, the assertions shown must also have the specified headers matching the provided values.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] known [known-OPTIONS]

       --remote

   list
       List installed snaps

       The list command displays a summary of snaps installed in the current system.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] list [list-OPTIONS]

       --all  Show all revisions

   login
       Authenticate to snapd and the store

       The  login  command  authenticates  the  user  to  snapd  and  the  snap store, and saves credentials into the
       ~/.snap/auth.json file. Further communication with snapd will then be made using those credentials.

       It's not necessary to log in to interact with snapd. Doing so, however,  enables  purchasing  of  snaps  using
       'snap buy', as well as some some developer-oriented features as detailed in the help for the find, install and
       refresh commands.

       An account can be set up at https://login.ubuntu.com

   logout
       Log out of snapd and the store

       The logout command logs the current user out of snapd and the store.

   logs
       Retrieve logs of services

       The logs command fetches logs of the given services and displays them in chronological order.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] logs [logs-OPTIONS]

       -n <default: "10">
              Show only the given number of lines, or 'all'.

       -f     Wait for new lines and print them as they come in.

   pack
       Pack the given directory as a snap

       The pack command packs the given snap-dir as a snap and writes the result  to  target-dir.  If  target-dir  is
       omitted,  the  result is written to current directory. If both source-dir and target-dir are omitted, the pack
       command packs the current directory.

       When used with --check-skeleton, pack only checks whether snap-dir contains valid snap metadata and raises  an
       error  otherwise.  Application  commands listed in snap metadata file, but appearing with incorrect permission
       bits result in an error. Commands that are missing from snap-dir are listed in diagnostic messages.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] pack [pack-OPTIONS]

       --check-skeleton
              Validate snap-dir metadata only

   prefer
       Prefer aliases from a snap and disable conflicts

       The prefer command enables all aliases of the given snap in preference to conflicting aliases of  other  snaps
       whose aliases will be disabled (or removed, for manual ones).

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] prefer [prefer-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

   refresh
       Refresh a snap in the system

       The refresh command updates the specified snaps, or all snaps in the system if none are specified.

       With no further options, the snaps are refreshed to the current revision of the channel they're tracking, pre‐
       serving their confinement options.

       Revision choice via the --revision override requires the the user to have developer access to the snap, either
       directly or through the store's collaboration feature, and to be logged in (see 'snap help login').

       Note a later refresh will typically undo a revision override.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] refresh [refresh-OPTIONS]

       --abs-time
              Display  absolute  times  (in  RFC  3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times up to 60 days, then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

              Put snap in classic mode and disable security confinement

       --amend
              Allow refresh attempt on snap unknown to the store

       --revision
              Refresh to the given revision, to which you must have developer access

       --list Show available snaps for refresh but do not perform a refresh

       --time Show auto refresh information but do not perform a refresh

       --ignore-validation
              Ignore validation by other snaps blocking the refresh

   remove
       Remove a snap from the system

       The remove command removes the named snap from the system.

       By default all the snap revisions are removed, including their data and the  common  data  directory.  When  a
       --revision option is passed only the specified revision is removed.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] remove [remove-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       --revision
              Remove only the given revision

   restart
       Restart services

       The restart command restarts the given services.

       If  the  --reload  option  is  given,  for  each service whose app has a reload command, a reload is performed
       instead of a restart.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] restart [restart-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       --reload
              If the service has a reload command, use it instead of restarting.

   revert
       Reverts the given snap to the previous state

       The revert command reverts the given snap to its state before the latest refresh.  This  will  reactivate  the
       previous  snap revision, and will use the original data that was associated with that revision, discarding any
       data changes that were done by the latest revision. As an exception, data which the snap explicitly chooses to
       share across revisions is not touched by the revert process.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] revert [revert-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       --devmode

       --shell
              Run a shell instead of the command (useful for debugging)

       --strace [="with-strace"] <default: "no-strace">
              Run  the  command  under  strace  (useful for debugging). Extra strace options can be specified as well
              here. Pass --raw to strace early snap helpers.

       --gdb  Run the command with gdb

   services
       Query the status of services

       The services command lists information about the services specified, or about the services  in  all  currently
       installed snaps.

   set
       Change configuration options

       The set command changes the provided configuration options as requested.

           $ snap set snap-name username=frank password=$PASSWORD

       All configuration changes are persisted at once, and only after the snap's configuration hook returns success‐
       fully.

       Nested values may be modified via a dotted path:

           $ snap set author.name=frank

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] set [set-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait

       --enable
              As well as starting the service now, arrange for it to be started on boot.

   stop
       Stop services

       The stop command stops, and optionally disables, the given services.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] stop [stop-OPTIONS]

              As well as stopping the service now, arrange for it to no longer be started on boot.

   switch
       Switches snap to a different channel

       The switch command switches the given snap to a different channel without doing a refresh.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] switch [switch-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
              Do not wait for the operation to finish but just print the change id.

       --channel
              Use this channel instead of stable

       --abs-time
              Display absolute times (in RFC 3339 format). Otherwise, display relative times  up  to  60  days,  then
              YYYY-MM-DD.

       --last Select last change of given type (install, refresh, remove, try, auto-refresh etc.)

   try
       Test a snap in the system

       The  try  command  installs  an unpacked snap into the system for testing purposes.  The unpacked snap content
       continues to be used even after installation, so  non-metadata  changes  there  go  live  instantly.  Metadata
       changes such as those performed in snap.yaml will require reinstallation to go live.

       If  snap-dir  argument  is omitted, the try command will attempt to infer it if either snapcraft.yaml file and
       prime directory or meta/snap.yaml file can be found relative to current working directory.

       Usage: snap [OPTIONS] try [try-OPTIONS]

       --no-wait
