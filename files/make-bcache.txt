make-bcache(8)                                 System Manager's Manual                                 make-bcache(8)

NAME
       make-bcache - create a cache device

SYNOPSIS
       make-bcache [ -U UUID ] [ -b bucket-size ] device

OPTIONS
       -C     Create a cache

       -B     Create a backing device (kernel functionality not yet implemented)

       -U UUID
              Create a cache device with the specified UUID

       -b bucket-size
              Specifies  the  bucket  size.  Allocation  is  done in terms of buckets, and cache hits are counted per
              bucket; thus a smaller bucket size will give better cache utilization, but  poorer  write  performance.
              The  bucket  size  is  intended  to  be equal to the size of your SSD's erase blocks, which seems to be
              128k-512k for most SSDs. Must be a power of two; accepts human readable units. Defaults to 128k.

                                                                                                       make-bcache(8)
