DESCRIPTION
       sosreport  generates  an  archive of configuration and diagnostic information from the running system. The ar‐
       chive may be stored locally or centrally for recording or tracking purposes or may be sent to  technical  sup‐
       port  representatives,  developers  or system administrators to assist with technical fault-finding and debug‐
       ging.

       Sos is modular in design and is able to collect data from a wide range of subsystems and packages that may  be
       installed.  An  XML  or  HTML  report summarizing the collected information is optionally generated and stored
       within the archive.

OPTIONS
       -l, --list-plugins
              List all available plugins and their options. Plug-ins that would not be enabled by the current config‐
              uration are listed separately.

       -n, --skip-plugins PLUGNAME[,PLUGNAME]
              Disable  the  specified  plugin(s).  Multiple plug-ins may be specified by repeating the option or as a
              comma-separated list.

       -e, --enable-plugins PLUGNAME[,PLUGNAME]
              Enable the specified plugin(s). Multiple plug-ins may be specified by repeating  the  option  or  as  a
              comma-separated list.

       -o, --only-plugins PLUGNAME[,PLUGNAME]
              Enable  the  specified  plugin(s)  only (all other plugins should be disabled). Multiple plugins may be
              specified by repeating the option or as a comma-separated list.

       -k PLUGNAME.PLUGOPT[=VALUE], --plugin-option=PLUGNAME.PLUGOPT[=VALUE]
              Specify plug-in options. The option PLUGOPT is enabled, or set to the specified value  in  the  plug-in
              PLUGNAME.

       -a, --alloptions
              Set all boolean options to True for all enabled plug-ins.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase logging verbosity. May be specified multiple times to enable additional debugging messages.

       -q, --quiet
              Only log fatal errors to stderr.

       --no-report
              Disable HTML/XML report writing.

       --config-file CONFIG
              Specify alternate configuration file.

       -s, --sysroot SYSROOT
              Specify an alternate root file system path. Useful for collecting reports from containers and images.

       -c, --chroot {auto|always|never}
              Set  the  chroot  mode.  When  --sysroot is used commands default to executing with SYSROOT as the root
              directory (unless disabled by a specific plugin). This can be overriden by setting --chroot to "always"
              (always chroot) or "never" (always run in the host namespace).

       --tmp-dir DIRECTORY
              Specify alternate temporary directory to copy data as well as the compressed report.

       --list-profiles
              Display a list of available profiles and the plugins that they enable.

       -p, --profile NAME
              Only  run  plugins  that correspond to the given profile. Multple profiles may be specified as a comma-
              separated list; the set of plugins executed is the union of each of the  profile's  plugin  sets.  Cur‐
              rently defined profiles include: boot, cluster, desktop, debug, hardware, identity, network, openstack,
              packagemanager, security, services, storage, sysmgmt, system, performance, virt, and webserver.

       --verify
              Instructs plugins to perform plugin-specific verification during  data  collection.  This  may  include
              package  manager verification, log integrity testing or other plugin defined behaviour. Use of --verify
              may cause the time taken to generate a report to be considerably longer.

       --log-size
              Places a global limit on the size (in MiB) of any collected set of logs. The  limit  is  applied  sepa‐
              rately for each set of logs collected by any plugin.

       --all-logs
              Tell  plugins  to  collect  all  possible  log data ignoring any size limits and including logs in non-
              default locations. This option may significantly increase the size of reports.

       -z, --compression-type METHOD
              Override the default compression type specified by the active policy.

       --batch
              Generate archive without prompting for interactive input.

       --name NAME
              Specify a name to be used for the archive.

       --case-id NUMBER
              Specify a case identifier to associate with the archive.  Identifiers may include alphanumeric  charac‐
              ters, commas and periods ('.').  Synonymous with --ticket-number.

       --ticket-number NUMBER
              Specify  a  ticket  number  or other identifier to associate with the archive.  Identifiers may include
              alphanumeric characters, commas and periods ('.').  Synonymous with --case-id.

       --build
              Do not archive copied data. Causes sosreport to leave an uncompressed archive as a  temporary  file  or
              directory tree.

       --debug
              Enable  interactive debugging using the python debugger. Exceptions in sos or plug-in code will cause a
              trap to the pdb shell.

       --experimental
              Enable plugins marked as experimental. Experimental plugins may not have been tested for this  port  or
              may still be under active development.

       --help Display usage message.
