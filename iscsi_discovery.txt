NAME
       iscsi_discovery - discover iSCSI targets

SYNOPSIS
       iscsi_discovery <IP> [-p <port>] [-d] [-t <tcp|iser> [-f]] [-m] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
       Perform  send-targets  discovery  to the specified IP. If a discovery record is generated, try to login to the
       portal using the preferred transport (-t flag specifies the requested transport type, TCP is the default).  If
       login  using  a  certain transport succeeds, mark the portal for automatic login (unless -m flag is used), and
       disconnect (unless -l flag is used).

       For iSCSI discovery to work, open-iscsi services must be running. i.e. iscsid should be up, and the iSCSI mod‐
       ules loaded. This is best accomplished by the init.d startup script.

       [-p=]port-number
              set the port number (defualt is 3260).

       [-d]   print debugging information.

       [-t=]transport-type
              set transport (default is tcp).

       [-f]   force specific transport - disable the fallback to tcp (default is fallback enabled).  force the trans‐
              port specified by the argument of the -t flag.

       [-m]   manual startup - will set manual startup (default is automatic startup).

       [-l]   login - login to the new discovered nodes (defualt is false).
