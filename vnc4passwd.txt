NAME
       vncpasswd - change a VNC password

SYNOPSIS
       vncpasswd [passwd-file]

DESCRIPTION
       vncpasswd  allows you to set the password used to access VNC desktops.  It stores an obfuscated version of the
       password in the given file (default $HOME/.vnc/passwd).  The vncserver script runs vncpasswd  the  first  time
       you start a VNC desktop, and invokes Xvnc with the appropriate -rfbauth option.  vncviewer can also be given a
       password file to use via the -passwd option.

       The password must be at least six characters long, and only the first eight characters are significant.   Note
       that the stored password is not encrypted securely - anyone who has access to this file can trivially find out
       the plaintext password, so vncpasswd always sets appropriate permissions (read and write only by  the  owner).
       However,  when accessing a VNC desktop a challenge-response mechanism is used over the wire making it hard for
       anyone to crack the password simply by snooping on the network.

FILES
       $HOME/.vnc/passwd
              Default location of the VNC password file.
