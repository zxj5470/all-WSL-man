NAME
       growpart - extend a partition in a partition table to fill available space

SYNOPSIS
       growpart [OPTIONS] DISK PARTITION-NUMBER

       growpart partition
          rewrite partition table so that partition takes up all the space it can
          options:
           -h | --help      print Usage an exit
                --fudge F   if part could be resized, but change would be
                            less than 'F', do not resize (default: 20480)
           -N | --dry-run   only report what would be done, show new 'sfdisk -d'
           -v | --verbose   increase verbosity / debug

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
              Show usage and exit

       -N | --dry-run
              Only report what would be done

       --fudge COUNT
              Only modify partition table if the given partition would grow more than COUNT sectors (512 bytes).  The
              default value is 20480 indicating that no change will be made unless more than 10M of  space  would  be
              gained.

       -v | --verbose
              Give more information to stderr.

ARGUMENTS
       DISK   The device or disk image to operate on

       PARTITION-NUMBER
              The number of the partition to resize (counting from 1)

DESCRIPTION
       Rewrite  a  partition  table  in a disk or disk image so that the given partition takes up as much space as it
       can.  After running, the partition will end at the end of the disk, or at the beginning of the next partition.

EXAMPLES
       Extend partition 1 in /dev/sda to fill empty space until end of disk or next partition
                 growpart /dev/sda 1

       Extend partition 2 in disk image my.image.
                 growpart my.image 2

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is 0 if the partition was successfully grown or if --dry-run was specified  and  it  could  be
       grown.  The exit status is 1 if the partition could not be grown due to lack of available space. The exit sta‐
       tus is 2 if an error occurred.
