DESCRIPTION
       fanctl is used to set up, tear down, and inspect Fan bridge mappings and devices in the linux kernel.

       NOTE:  Future  versions  of the commands will make fanatic the primary interface for interacting with Fan net‐
              works.  For maximum portability fanctl should only be used if absolutely necessary.

       A network Fan is a mechanism for expanding the range of IP addresses available to a system.  It is most useful
       for  containers such as Docker and LXC/LXD, but it can be used in other contexts as well.  Fan works by creat‐
       ing a bridge that uses a mathematical mapping between the host's (or underlay's) /16 address and the Fan's (or
       overlay's) /8 address. By mapping addresses in this way, a 253-fold increase in address space can be achieved.
       For example, if the host machine uses a subnet of 172.16.0.0/16 and assigns a 250.0.0.0/8 Fan to an IP address
       of 172.16.3.4, the hosts's Fan overlay addresses will be in the 250.3.4.0/24 subnet, where 250 is derived from
       the user defined overlay network prefix.

COMMAND SYNTAX
       fanctl up -u <underlay> -o <overlay> [<options>]
              Sets up a new Fan bridge mapping overlay addresses to the corresponding underlay addresses on the local
              network.   Using  the  example,  the  new  bridge  is  named  fan-250 based on the overlay and underlay
              addresses specified (see ADDRESSING below).  The options are described in the OPTIONS section below.

       fanctl down -u <underlay> -o <overlay>
              Tears down a previously-configured Fan bridge and associated mapping.  This action  will  fail  if  the
              bridge is still in use.

       fanctl up -a
              Sets up all Fans defined in /etc/network/fan if present.

       fanctl down -a
              Tears  down all automatically defined Fan bridges on the system.  These may be identified in the fanctl
              show output via the auto flag.

       fanctl down -e
              Tears down all defined Fan bridges on the system.

       fanctl show
              Lists all currently defined Fan bridges in the system; for instance:

              # fanctl show
              Bridge       Underlay        Overlay       Flags
              fan-250      172.16.3.4/16   250.0.0.0/8   dhcp host-reserve 1

       fanctl config set -u <underlay> -o <overlay> [<options>...]
              Sets configuration options for the underlay/overlay combination specified  (or  clears  any  individual
              configuration if no options are specified).
              To  add  options, the current set of options has to be obtained via fanctl config show and added to the
              list of new options.

       fanctl config show -u <underlay> -o <overlay>
              Displays any additional configuration options for the underlay/overlay combination specified.

       fanctl config list
              Displays all underlay/overlay combinations which have additional configuration.

       fanctl help [<command>]
              Displays basic usage information for fanctl.  When used with a specific command limits output  to  that
              command.

ADDRESSING
       The  Fan mapping is defined by a combination of the underlay and overlay addresses.  Each is defined as a CIDR
       network address.  For example:

              # fanctl up -u 172.16.3.4/16 -o 250.0.0.0/8

       This example defines an overlay of 250.0.0.0/8 and an underlay of 172.16.3.4/16.  When mapping an  address  in
       the 250.0.0.0/8 subnet, we take the 16 bits of destination address starting at bit 8 and replace the bottom 16
       bits of the underlay address with it.  For example, attempting to talk to 250.3.4.15 will trigger  the  packet
       to be sent to 172.16.3.4 for delivery.

       It  is not always possible to know the local underlay address at the time the configuration is generated (such
       as when a common configuration is desired on all systems).  In this case we can specify the  underlay  address
       using only the underlay prefix, or by reference to an interface.

       For  example, to bring up a Fan bridge slice for each address in the 172.16.0.0/16 subnet, the following exam‐
       ple examines each interface as it is currently configured and configures a matching slice at that time:

              # fanctl up -u 172.16.0.0/16 -o 250.0.0.0/8

       To bring up Fan slices corresponding to the addresses on a specific interface we can substitute the  interface
       name:

              # fanctl up -u ens3/16 -o 250.0.0.0/8

       To bring up Fan slices corresponding to the addresses on the primary network interface (the interface with the
       default route), the keyword default can be substituted:

              # fanctl up -u default/16 -o 250.0.0.0/8

LIMITATIONS
       Currently Fan can only apply overlay addresses with a /8 network mask, and underlay addresses with a /16  net‐
       work mask.  We expect to relax this limitation in a later update.

OPTIONS
       -u <underlay>|--underlay=<underlay>
              Specify the underlay network address and mask.

       -o <overlay>|--overlay=<overlay>
              Specify the overlay network address and mask.

       --type=<type>
              Sets  the encapsulation type for this Fan bridge.  May be ipip or vxlan (default) only.  You should not
              normally need to specify this.

       --mode=<mode>
              Sets the bridge mode.  May be compact (default) or sliced only.  In compact mode a  single  Fan  bridge
              per  overlay  network  is  created.   In  sliced mode a Fan bridge is created for each local Fan slice.
              sliced mode is considered legacy.  You should not normally need to specify this.

       --dhcp Turns on automatic address allocation for the Fan bridge.  A dnsmasq instance is  started  attached  to
              the bridge allocating the unreserved addresses to entities attached to the Fan bridge.

       --host-reserve=<count>
              By  default  the .1 address on the Fan bridge is allocated to the host, enabling it to communicate with
              entities on the Fan bridge. This option reserves additional addresses for host applications to  use.  A
              host-reserve 4 reserves .1 through .4 in the Fan bridge for host use.

       --bridge=<name>
              By  default  the  bridge  name is based on the overlay and underlay addresses specified (see ADDRESSING
              above). This option overrides the name to one you specify.

       --enable
              This option marks the Fan bridge to be automatically configured when the underlying interface comes up.
              This  is  primarily  used  in the local Fan persistent configuration to enable centrally configured Fan
              mappings on a specific host.  (See PERSISTENT CONFIGURATION below).

PERSISTENT CONFIGURATION
       NOTE: The location and content of the configuration files should still be considered unstable  as  they  could
       change  in future. Use of fanatic is highly recommended as this command will make any necessary changes to the
       right config files.

       Fan mappings are configured via /etc/network/fan by pairs of local (underlay) and overlay  network  addresses.
       The  first  element  of each pair specifies the underlay range which should be mapped into the overlay network
       specified by the second element. For example:

              # RFC1918 - we recommend you use these for easy interop with
              # other FAN users on small private networks. They provide
              # around 250 IP's per 192.168.0.0/16 address, or 16 per
              # 172.16.0.0/12 address.

              # local         overlay
              192.168.0.0/16  250.0.0.0/8
              172.16.0.0/12   251.0.0.0/8

       Comments are introduced via a hash (#), and blank lines are ignored.

       Note, that the local (underlay) range does not need to match the subnet mask of the interface as long  as  all
       addresses  of  the  larger scope are routeable. If for example the interface is configured as 192.168.122.2/24
       but can reach all 192.168.0.0/16 addresses that will be part of the Fan network, the local (underlay)  address
       of 192.168.0.0/16 can be used regardless.

       It  is  expected that the /etc/network/fan configuration is globally managed ensuring that all hosts have con‐
       sistent overlay to underlay mappings.  Local deviation is managed via  the  fanctl  config  subcommand.   This
       allow a local host to record additional flags against a specific overlay/underlay combination.  For example:

              # fanctl config set -u 172.16.0.0/16 -o 250.0.0.0/8 --enable

       will  set  the  --enable option to the local host configuration, triggering this Fan to be configured when the
       host interface is configured.

FAN BRIDGES
       By default each Fan bridge represents a Fan overlay network which is expressed locally on  the  machine.   The
       Fan bridge will have the various slice addresses mapped to it.

       In  legacy  sliced mode each Fan bridge represents a slice of a Fan overlay network which is expressed locally
       on the machine.  The Fan bridge will have the overlay addresses representing one local IP  address  mapped  to
       it.  A machine may have more than one local address on the underlay network, enabling it to have more than one
       such slice mapped.  It may also have more than one overlay range defined for each local IP address.

       Each Fan bridge is a separate broadcast domain, with routing between the bridges  both  locally  and  globally
       within the Fan.

       Each  Fan bridge appears as a bridge on the system, named for the overlay subnet hosted by that particular Fan
       bridge and the underlay address prefix for which it carries traffic.  For our 250.0.0.0/8 on 172.16.3.4  exam‐
       ple, the bridge would be named fan-250 and would carry all traffic for 250.3.4.0/24.
