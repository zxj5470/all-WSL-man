NAME
       x0vncserver - VNC server which continuously polls an X display

SYNOPSIS
       x0vncserver [parameters]

DESCRIPTION
       x0vncserver is a VNC server which continuously polls any X display, allowing it to be controlled via VNC.  How
       usable it will be depends a lot on the machine it's running on, and what you're expecting.   It  won't  be  as
       fast  as Xvnc or a native X server with VNC support compiled in, but in many cases it is the best option since
       it is just an ordinary X application requiring no special installation.

       It has many of the same parameters as Xvnc.  Running x0vncserver -h  will  give  a  list  of  parameters  with
       descriptions.   Note  that  you need to explicitly specify an appropriate password file using the PasswordFile
       parameter.
